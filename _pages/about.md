Originally from Chicago, IL, I traded in polar vortices for beaches and sun on the West Coast. I have a PhD in physics from UCLA (go bruins!) and undergraduate degrees in physics, math, and integrated science from Northwestern University. My <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5cb2s328">doctoral dissertation</a> was in theoretical soft matter, on the role of curvature in lower dimensional elastic systems.

I'm currently interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and enjoy learning and writing about machine learning. You can check out some of my blog posts on my <a href="https://medium.com/@jmkernes">medium page<a>. Within AI, I specialize in the field of **Natural Language Processing**, and am currently interested in Neural Machine Translation.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, basketball, and hip hop. In a former life I used to produce hip-hop beats, but am in a constant struggle to find the time to keep doing so. I'm also a big fan of languages, and can speak Spanish moderately well, as well as Chinese at an elementary level.
